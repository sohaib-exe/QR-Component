![Design preview for the QR code component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). And after solving this I agree that Frontend Mentor challenges do help you improve your skills.
